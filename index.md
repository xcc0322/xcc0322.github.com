Nice to meet you. ![photo](http://hdn.xnimg.cn/photos/hdn521/20130714/1525/large_qutA_ec0300055ffa113e.jpg){: style="float:right;padding:30px;" width="125"}

I'm Chengcheng（程程 in Chinese), a 21-year-old Chinese girl currently a junior student majoring in Computer Science in [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn).

I was born and raised up in a beautiful costal city Qingdao and went to university in Shanghai in Semptember 2011.

My interests lie in three things **computer science**, **music** and broad **reading**. I believe they will just accompany me all life.

I put some knowledge notes, logs and essays here. Share my joy of life and see me grow.
