I'm Chengcheng, a 21-year-old Chinese girl from China.

Currently I'm a junior student majoring in Computer Science in [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn).

You can find some info about me and read my posts here.

I was born and raised up in a beautiful costal city Qingdao and went to university in Shanghai in Semptember 2011. Recently, I also stayed in Hsinchu, Taiwan for a semester as an exchange student in 2013.

My most interests lie in three things - computer science, music and broad reading.
